# Odin Recipes Project

This is the first project in the Odin curriculum course.

The project is a recipe site with an individual page for each recipe. The page contains a brief recipe description, an image of the prepared meal, and lists of ingredients & preparation steps.

Recipes published in this project are taken from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
